## 📌 Project Descriptions

### 🔐 1. Bank Account Security System

**File:** `Bank_account_security.py`, `secure_bank_account.py`  
**Concepts Used:**

- Encapsulation
- Private variables
- Secure data access

**Description:**  
Implements a secure bank account where balance cannot be accessed directly.  
Deposit and withdrawal operations are validated properly.

### 🎓 3. Student Result System

**File:** `student_result_system.py`  
**Concepts Used:**

- Encapsulation
- Getters & Setters
- Data validation

**Description:**  
Stores student marks securely with validation (0–100).  
Demonstrates controlled access to sensitive academic data.

### 💳 6. Payment Gateway System

**File:** `payment_gateway.py`  
**Concepts Used:**

- Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
- Polymorphism

**Description:**  
Implements multiple payment methods (UPI, Card, NetBanking)  
using a common abstract interface.

---

### 🛒 7. E-Commerce Order System

**File:** `E-Commerce_Order_System.py`  
**Concepts Used:**

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Composition
- Polymorphism
- Abstract Base Classes

**Description:**  
A mini e-commerce backend design handling users, orders, and payments  
using clean OOP architecture.
