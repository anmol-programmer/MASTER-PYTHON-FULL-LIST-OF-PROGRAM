# 🧠 Functional Programming in Python (Job-Ready)

This repository contains **10 job-ready coding questions** based on **Functional Programming in Python**, covering real interview-level concepts such as **lambda functions, map, filter, reduce, and closures**.

These problems are designed to help you **think functionally**, write **clean Python code**, and prepare for **backend, data, and software engineering roles**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Lambda Functions
- `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Closures
- Functional Pipelines
- Data Transformation & Aggregation
- Interview-oriented problem solving

---

## 🚀 Why Functional Programming?

Functional programming helps you:

- Write **clean and concise code**
- Avoid unnecessary state changes
- Improve **code readability & maintainability**
- Work efficiently with **data processing pipelines**

Many companies test these skills in **Python interviews**.

## 🧪 Job-Ready Coding Questions

### 1️⃣ Square of Even Numbers

Use `lambda`, `map`, and `filter` to return the square of only even numbers from a list.

---

### 2️⃣ Employee Salary Filter

Filter employee records whose salary is greater than 50,000 using `filter()`.

---

### 3️⃣ Product of Numbers

Use `reduce()` to calculate the product of all numbers in a list.

---

### 4️⃣ Functional Password Validator

Filter valid passwords based on:

- Minimum length (≥ 8)
- At least one digit  
  (_Use lambda + filter only_)

---

### 5️⃣ Login System using Closures

Create a closure-based login system that validates a password and grants or denies access.

---

### 6️⃣ Sorting with Lambda

Sort a list of `(name, age, salary)` tuples by salary in descending order using `lambda`.

---

### 7️⃣ Data Cleaning using `map()`

Convert mixed data types (strings & integers) into integers using `map()`.

---

### 8️⃣ Counter using Closures

Create a closure that keeps track of how many times a function is called.

---

### 9️⃣ Salary Tax Calculator

Apply 10% tax to each salary using `map()` and calculate total tax using `reduce()`.

---

### 🔟 Functional Pipeline (Advanced)

Perform the following using **filter → map → reduce**:

1. Remove odd numbers
2. Square remaining numbers
3. Calculate the sum
